I'm a Ph.D student of Computer Science in University of Utah. My research interests mainly lie in probalistic machine learning. More specif- ically, it’s about using probalistic frameworks to formulate learning problems and estimate model parameters. Probalistic modeling is much akin to peoples’ reasoning in the real world. For a certain event, the uncertainty about the event’s happening is quantified by conditional probabilities, in which the con- ditions are also events always called prior. With the prior knowledge, and the model we have built, when the event happens, we can get the feedback and update confidence about the event which is called posterior. Furthermore, we can use updated confidence to predict following events or compare the models we built for the same event. However, during the process, we always need to marginalize the probability which can be computationally expensive or even in- tractable. So researchers make efforts to calculate or approximate marginals in an effcient way, giving rise to the category probalistic inference.
